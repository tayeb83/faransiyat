      "content"  : "Alright, let‚Äôs get into the weeds this week (or perhaps flowers?). Overall, I think I‚Äôve found a good equilibrium with Beeminder. I don‚Äôt often derail, but at the same time I have over a dozen beemergencies every single day.\n\nI‚Äôm also really happy for the spread of systems I have, finding ways to track my mental health, physical health, hobbies, and both creative and technical projects.\n\nRegarding French, I‚Äôve been stuck in the Emerald league forever in /duolingo, but progressing down the tree nonetheless. /clozemaster is definitely a welcomed addition, as the lessons are a lot quicker and give a more nuanced look at how words are actually used.\n\nSince I began tracking /writing in May, I‚Äôve written over 100,000 words, which is crazy to me. Although a good portion is just private journal writing, I‚Äôm still happy I‚Äôm doing it everyday. Before, I‚Äôd really try to win NaNoWriMo every year (anybody participating, btw?) and always fall short because I never wrote &gt;1,500 words a day otherwise. I suppose I‚Äôd rather write ~400 words a day indefinitely than risk pushing and burning myself out.\n\nI‚Äôm still finding a bug (or maybe feature) where /meditation doesn‚Äôt add data if you‚Äôre repeating a guided meditation. I‚Äôve switched over to doing simple timed meditation with Insight Timer and that seems to work instead!\n\nI recently derailed on /fitness by just a couple hundred steps, which initially seemed silly. But in reality, I have to remind myself that whatever I‚Äôm tracking on Beeminder is the bare-minimum threshold, and I gotta pass it everyday no matter what.\n\nOne thing I‚Äôve noticed that I talked about on the Beeminder Discord (which you should join!) is that all my systems ultimately fall within two categories: input-based vs. output-based.\n\nNow, when I originally began with Beeminder many years ago, I had the rhetoric that you should aim for looking at input rather that output. Which I still believe is better‚Äìbut why not both if that‚Äôs an option?\n\nThere are a few examples of this: /writing is the input, and other goals like /blogging or /poetry are output. (A caveat being that writing is fortunately easy to both quantify and automate.)\n\nOutput-based goals that I‚Äôve been having the most trouble with are the ones that I haven‚Äôt really found a good input-based supplementary goal to add to it. I do really well with beemergencys pushing me towards doing work, but output goals don‚Äôt have a daily metric, they‚Äôre usually weekly or monthly.\n\nI finally had the brilliant idea to use RescueTime and track the amount of time that I‚Äôm specifically on Lynda each day to supplement /courses. I had a few good ideas for tracking pages read or time with /books, but I often get weasel-y if the data isn‚Äôt automated. üòÖ So it‚Äôd be nice to figure out a way to connect with Kindle or Audible.\n\n(P.S. Working on a new Jekyll theme this week, Purelog!)\n\n(P.S.S. Anybody doing NaNoWriMo this year? Using Beeminder to track it?)"

I would be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt anxious for tonight, so I better finish this weekly review as early as possible :^)\n\nFirst off, my apologies for this post not being very Beeminder-specific, I‚Äôve been getting dedicated with my development work with Jekyll the past week. So I haven‚Äôt really given the time needed to examine how my Beeminder goals have been affecting things in my life, like I usually (neurotically) do. I‚Äôm planning to do a full review of my now 24(!) systems.\n\nSome bad news and good news: The bad news is that I definitely bit off more than I can chew with trying to modify Simply Jekyll. It already had a 1,300 line CSS file, and I decided it would be a good idea to add Bootstrap on top of that, and although I love how it looks and what it‚Äôs capable of, it‚Äôs hopelessly bloated.\n\nThe good news is that I successfully completed Hacktoberfest for the first time! But even better, I went back to the drawing board and created my first open-source project for others: Watery, which is the most minimal yet functional Jekyll theme I could create. I went down the rabbit hole of classless CSS frameworks and used the most popular one, Water.css, for this.\n\nI also just added a neat feature on the demo site that lets you effortlessly see how it would look using a different classless CSS framework instead, which really demonstrates its extensibility.\n\nTo tie it back to relevancy, I am probably going to use a variant of this theme for my Beeminder blog journal.bar. Speaking of, I‚Äôve been thinking more down-the-line about this experiment, and trying to figure out if there would be any meaningful way to measure difference from the beginning to, say, a year after. I can offer my own layman‚Äôs observations, but it‚Äôd be neat to be an academic guinea pig."

I figure I‚Äôll add a new document each month, as I find that‚Äôs a good time-frame to segment writing. And unlike Draft, URLminder lets you change the deadline time, which was my entire problem in the first place. The caveat being that I‚Äôll need to adjust to writing somewhere else consistently.\n\nThis week‚Äôs verbal contract will be: To get a better at understanding API. Although I‚Äôve found multiple new systems within the unofficial integration lists that I‚Äôm excited to use, it made me realize how much more potential there is‚Äìand perhaps the frustration that 3rd party solutions seem so ephemeral. Khan Academy, for instance, have deprecated their API entirely. FreeCodeCamp hasn‚Äôt had theirs updated in nearly two years. Is interest in this kind of things just too niche?\n\nOn the other hand, I think there‚Äôs benefit in there only being thirty or so high-quality official integrations. I know when I first was starting out, I didn‚Äôt feel overwhelmed by the paradox of choice.\n\nNew Systems\n\nAs I‚Äôve written about a few weeks ago, limitation breeds creativity for me. It‚Äôs been fun trying to work with just the official integrations, but this would not be an experiment of self-improvement if stagnation was allowed! Exciting things are going on, I‚Äôm trying a bunch of new stuff.\n\n\n  /ClozeMaster: Supplement my French learning with Duolingo\n  /Meditation: It‚Äôs so cool how you can use Apple Health to track mindful minutes with different meditation apps. I‚Äôm still have to figure out my favorite but right now I‚Äôm using Headspace.\n  /Prayer: Using Rosarium (Beeminder‚Äôs blog post about it), my relationship with spirituality is complicated, but I definitely enjoy the Rosary prayer, and it‚Äôs a good way to start my days with the right intentions.\n\n\nP.S. I figured out why RescueTime was still measuring time even though I was AFK. It has to do with a pesky design flaw (more detail) of the ThinkPad W520 (which, by the way, is the best laptop ever minus this one thing).\n\nP.S.S.

I‚Äôm really enjoying becoming increasingly focused on both the weeds of technicalities, as well as trying to think deeper on the higher concepts that I‚Äôm trying to utilize.\n\nFor starters, I‚Äôve written in the past about wanting to pivot, but I realize that I am perfectly capable of adding work rather than changing what this project is.\n\nI‚Äôve also written about wanting to give myself more self-permission. Essentially, I want a place that‚Äôs truly mine where I can place my thoughts exhaustively. Not just polished, finished work such as my blog or portfolio. I‚Äôm writing roughly 400 words a day anyways, it might as well be for a utilitarian purpose and public.\n\nAs much as I enjoy the concept of digital gardens as an ideal, I do have some problems with the specifics (also seen with Roam Research). It sort of reminds me of the Dvorak keyboard layout‚Äìfar more practical and productive, but alas I‚Äôm am already far too entrenched in both QWERTY and traditional, hierarchical note-taking.\n\nI also don‚Äôt want a specific program for private use, such as Notion. Rather, I found a wonderful Jekyll theme that incorporates a lot of the concepts that I am drawn towards: Backlinks, wiki-style links, context menu, page preview, margininlia, etc. You can see these being utilized here, it‚Äôs really cool.\n\nTo relate it back to Beeminder, in addition to collecting my notes, I want this to be a place for daily entries, that include getting more in-depth with my /gratitude journal, and /foodlog, for starters‚Äìand having the project be on GitHub means I can simply create a new system with GitMinder that only tracks that repository.\n\nAnyways, much more related to Beeminder, I‚Äôve been having trouble with URLminder. Currently, /morningpages2 is kind of just stuck at around 4,300 words for some reason‚Äìmaybe I just input the Google Doc link incorrectly. I also had to sadly archive /typing, since I couldn‚Äôt get my TypeRacer games to sync, but that was a just-for-fun goal anyways.\n\nP.S. Trying to get into APIs last week ended up snowballing into a new project of it‚Äôs own: SelfTeach.Academy. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôd be enough interest to try to make this a reality, though."

I‚Äôve noticed the iOS application updated though, so maybe it was just an anomaly.\n\nAlso, I think the reason things were weird with URLminder reading from Google Docs was simply because I didn‚Äôt set the privacy settings for the document correctly, whoops. Seems to be working now! I know it‚Äôs been forever since I initially started with this goal‚Äìand I haven‚Äôt really needed it since I‚Äôve started a devlog on Draft that I plan to migrate‚Äìbut I think it‚Äôs still worth finally implementing correctly.\n\nI‚Äôve been fumbling hard with /distraction lately. I‚Äôve been derailing due to incorrect labeling of different websites I‚Äôve been visiting, and it doesn‚Äôt update like other systems do, to the point where it‚Äôs 11:50 and it‚Äôs still orange because it hasn‚Äôt updated (and I know I shouldn‚Äôt be in front of a screen that late, but that‚Äôs another issue that needs to be tackled), which is a problem since it‚Äôs a do-less goal.\n\nThe simple solution to this is to just visit the RescueTime dashboard one per evening to make sure that the obscure sites I‚Äôm visiting are correctly labelled and that I‚Äôm not going over my unproductive screen-time limit."

However, I was a New Yorker for a whole year in 1930‚Äì 31 while attending advertising classes in Columbia‚Äôs School of Business. Actually I am a southerner, from Mississippi, the nation‚Äôs most backward state. Ramifications include Walter H. Page, who, unluckily for me, is no longer connected with Doubleday-Page, which is no longer Doubleday-Page, even. I have a B.A. (‚Äô 29) from the University of Wisconsin, where I majored in English without a care in the world. For the last eighteen months I was languishing in my own office in a radio station in Jackson, Miss., writing continuities, dramas, mule feed advertisements, santa claus talks, and life insurance playlets; now I have given that up‚Ä¶.The witty use of what I like to call a socio-cultural confabulation in the form of a movie review and a relatable but madeup word that is also original in a sense.  ‚Ä¶As to what I might do for you‚Äî I have seen an untoward amount of picture galleries and 15¬¢ movies lately, and could review them with my old prosperous detachment, I think; in fact, I recently coined a general word for Matisse‚Äôs pictures after seeing his latest at the Marie Harriman: concubineapple. That shows you how my mind works‚Äîquick, and away from the point. I read simply voraciously, and can drum up an opinion afterwards‚Ä¶The mention of India print and subtle showcase of how she knows the struggles in the industry without any explicit mention.  ‚Ä¶Since I have bought an India print, and a large number of phonograph records from a Mr. Nussbaum who picks them up, and a Cezanne Bathers one inch long (that shows you I read e. e. cummings I hope), I am anxious to have an apartment, not to mention a small portable phonograph. How I would like to work for you! A little paragraph each morning‚Äî a little paragraph each night, if you can‚Äôt hire me from daylight to dark, although I would work like a slave. I can also draw like Mr. Thurber, in case he goes off the deep end. I have studied flower painting‚Ä¶And the final invocation of the extremely common social contruct i.e., the leprechaun throw.  There is no telling where I may apply, if you turn me down; I realize this will not phase you, but consider my other alternative: the U of N.C. offers for $12.00 to let me dance in Vachel Lindsay‚Äôs Congo.

I rest my case, repeating that I am a hard worker.This may not have been the best application in a formal sense, but the reason people go to it is probably because what it reminds them of ‚Äî the cultural nostalgia (the shared social artefact).Another type of common artefact is sincere immitation of great works, the sincere admiration can help with the remembrance.

My experience has been that when I have had a bad last night sleep or stress due to office, I invariably am looking for less polarity, otherwise the dark on white seems more appealing to me both aesthetics wise and legibility wise.

When you are working for an organization or working independently on a collaborative oss, the major chunk of your cognitive bandwidth gets allocated to those projects, which is not bad per-se, it does teach you how to work in a collaborative environment and to learn from people who are better at the concerned technology/concept than you. But the issue is more personal and emotional in when you are working on something bigger than you, it unwittingly causes a self-effacive effect i.e., you tend to devalue the emotional effects of being able to create something with complete autonomy, or crave for the autonomy and burnout as a result of the cognitive exhaustion. The sense of freedom and the liberating experience that comes out of the creative autonomy is just unmatched.Even a side-project in github that you consider to be trivial has an effect that only such kind of projects can provide, of having done everything yourself and without anyone putting constraints on what you can and what you can‚Äôt. It allows you to experiment outside of what would be acceptable within a project you are doing with others. Something like what if I just re-wrote this entire engine on top of openGL would never (or almost never) make sense in a collaborative project, but it would make perfect sense if it is just you.The other obvious advantage is it makes you much more light-hearted because you know that if this doesn‚Äôt work out the way I like it or good for me, then I can just go. When you are working on a personal project out of your own free will, it has a certain kind of air that a collaborative project won‚Äôt. It is purely voluntary, and you can just up and leave at any time. That adds something to the mix. The responsibility of joy or stress that comes out of it suddenly becomes more tolerable as well as enjoyable. Note that I am not advocating that you drop everything that you don‚Äôt like, it is just that having certain things in your life that you can control can help handle that which you can‚Äôt.Related: [[Creativity is a quality without a name]]ReferencesAndreas Kling.

      "content"  : "Goal-oriented outlook for large-scale personal projects seem to be detrimental in a sense that in the absence of an enforcing agent it seems to be contributing to issues like will-power dissolution, decision fatigue, burn-out, guilt etc owing to the disincentives of self-enforced adherence to an idea/project for a long term. This is based on the idea by Kurzban et. al that overcommiting to a task, that is only expected to show its result in distant future, can dissolve will power to an extent of a burnout or complete unproductivity. And in my opinion, it not just affects the quantifiable components, it also affects your qualitative components like creative autonomy.After talking with few interesting people and trying out various different processes myself I have come to the conclusion that some of the strategies mentioned below can help in persistance of motivation in a long term personal project without any unnatural self-enforced adherence.
